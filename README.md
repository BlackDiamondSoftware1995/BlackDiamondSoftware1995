## About Me
# Alexander Macleod

Hey there, I'm Alexander Macleod, a **28-year-old** Nova Scotian with a winding journey. I'm on a quest to become a **Full Stack Web Developer** and **Software Engineer**, despite some rocky roads along the way.

## My Journey

My story isn't your typical one. I dropped out of high school during my 2nd year due to a diagnosis of **Psuedomyoxaperitoninel PMP Cancer**. Life threw me another curveball when I found myself serving a 3-year sentence in jail for **aggravated assault with a weapon**. But hey, even behind bars, I was determined to keep learning—I completed my **GED** and even scored in the high percentile.

In **2018**, just before the chaos of **COVID-19**, my son and daughter were born. Unfortunately, circumstances led my daughter and her mother to flee to **Ontario**, leaving me alone in rural Nova Scotia. That's when things took a darker turn. I fell into the grips of **IV Opiate**, **Ketamine**, and **Methamphetamine addiction**.

From **2020** to **2022**, I was deep in the underworld, selling substances to keep up with my own habit. But like any addiction story, it eventually caught up to me—I ended up **$25,000 in debt with the Mob over cocaine**.

By **2023**, my health was hanging by a thread. I was admitted to the hospital with a serious blood infection, an enlarged heart, and vegetation on my valves—**Endocarditis**.

But it wasn't all downhill. During my time in and out of the hospital, I became a catalyst for change. I advocated for **harm reduction protocols** in **Pictou County's** medical system. Now, IV drug addicts like myself are given their daily dose during hospital visits, ensuring proper care without judgment.

## Current Chapter: 2024

Fast forward to **2024**, and I'm over a year sober. I've taught myself everything I know about full stack development, constantly honing my skills in **PHP**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript**, **Node**, **Python**, and more.
